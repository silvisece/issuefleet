"""Narrow interfaces (ports) between the reconcile loop and the world.

Real implementations: linear.LinearTracker, github.GithubForge,
gitlab.GitlabForge, gitops.Git, runner.TmuxRunner. Tests substitute in-memory
fakes. Keeping these narrow is deliberate — GitLab slots in behind the Forge
port (Jira/others *could* slot in the same way), and that is as far as
pluggability goes (brief §8).
