"""The reconcile loop: one tick observes everything and converges the fleet.

Design rules (from the brief):
- per-worker exception isolation — one sick worker never stalls the fleet;
- every credentialed act is at-least-once with explicit dedupe: outbox
  messages stay pending until relayed (archive = ack), and every posted body
  carries an HTML-comment marker so a retry after a half-failure is a no-op;
- restart-safe: claims are idempotent (adopt existing worktrees/branches),
  the registry is written before side effects that a liveness check can
  repair, and orchestrator-origin comments use deterministic marker ids.
