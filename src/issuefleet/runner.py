"""Worker sessions: detached host tmux running claude-container.

Why tmux rather than a hand-rolled ``docker run`` (brief §5.1 asked for the
choice to be written down): the launcher requires a pty on stdin
(``docker run --rm -it``), which tmux provides for free; the operator gets
``tmux attach`` to watch or take over any worker live; output is captured
with ``pipe-pane -o`` so the pty stays intact; and — decisively — the
launcher's first-class handling of linked-worktree ``.git`` mounts would
otherwise have to be replicated by hand and kept in sync with every launcher
release. One worker = one tmux session = one container.

Session names are deterministic (``issuefleet-<project>-<KEY>``), so
adoption after an orchestrator restart is a ``tmux has-session`` away — we
never need to guess container names (which embed a pid).

    the agent is working, `issuefleet logs` shows nothing, and a killed session
