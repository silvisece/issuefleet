"""Security gate: scan what a `ready` would push for leaked credentials.

A worker's containers run with permission prompts disabled and hold no
credentials of their own — but nothing stops an agent from *committing* a
secret it generated, pasted, or scraped from the environment into its branch.
The one outbox action that carries such content into the repository is
`ready` (it force-pushes the branch and opens the PR). This module gates the
diff that a `ready` would push, host-side in the orchestrator, and lets the
gate reject with a rationale that the reconciler routes back into the worker's
inbox so the agent can fix it and submit again.

The design mirrors ``advisor.py``: a ``SecurityGate`` Protocol with a
deterministic default (``RegexSecretScanner``), an optional LLM backend
(``ClaudeSecurityGate``) that only *adds* findings, and a ``build_gate``
factory that degrades gracefully. Two invariants matter for a security seam:

- **Redact.** A finding never carries the matched secret verbatim — the
  rejection note and the archived outbox receipt are themselves durable
  artifacts, so echoing the key back would relocate the leak, not stop it.
  ``Finding.masked`` keeps only enough to identify the hit.
- **The deterministic scanner is authoritative.** The optional model can find
  *more*, but a model outage never *clears* a hit the regex scanner made and
  never wedges a submission — an API failure degrades to the regex result.
