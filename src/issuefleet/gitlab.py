"""GitLab REST v4 Forge implementation (personal / group / project access token).

The GitLab analog of github.GithubForge. Merge requests stand in for pull
requests, MR notes for review feedback, and commit statuses (the pipeline +
external-status aggregate) for CI. Like the GitHub forge, it also supplies the
credentials for git-over-HTTPS pushes and clones (push_spec): branches go out
with the same scoped token that opens MRs — never an SSH key. With the base
branch protected, the bot is MR-only by construction.

GitLab is routinely self-hosted, so the instance ``host`` is carried through:
the API base is ``https://<host>/api/v4`` and the project is addressed by its
URL-encoded ``group/subgroup/project`` path, which also covers nested groups.
