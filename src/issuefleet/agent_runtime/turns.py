"""Turn decisions: the one testable place that decides what the next turn is.

``decide()`` is pure — it reads the agent dir (brief, state, inbox) and
returns a Decision; it never launches anything. The turn loop is a dumb
consumer of decisions and their exit codes:

    0   run another turn (the Decision carries the prompt)
    10  idle: a question is pending, wait for a human reply
    20  idle: work submitted (ready), wait for review/merge
    30  shutdown / unclaimed — exit the loop
    40  auto-turn budget exhausted — idle instead of grinding
